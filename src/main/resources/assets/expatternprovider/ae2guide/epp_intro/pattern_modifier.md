It also can clear all patterns contents and turn them into blank patterns by clicking the Clear button.

### Notes:

 - The division button only works when its amount is divisible. For example รท2 button won't work when pattern requires 3x
cobblestones as input, because 3รท2 is 1.5.

 - The multiplication button has a cap(999999). It can't make single ingredient's amount over this number.
