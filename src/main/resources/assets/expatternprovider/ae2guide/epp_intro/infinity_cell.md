# ME Infinity Cell

An easy water and cobblestone sink but in storage cell form.

<Row>
<ItemImage id="expatternprovider:infinity_cell" scale="4"></ItemImage>
</Row>

They hold 2.1 billion items/fluids, and you can extract infinity cobblestone/water from them.

# Upgrade

ME Infinity Cell supports <ItemLink id="ae2:void_card" />. You can inject infinity cobblestone/water into the cell with 
overflow card. So you also can make it a trash bin for cobblestone/water.
